# AWS Elemental MediaTailor
This lab will take you through setting up MediaTailor using other AWS Elemental products like MediaLive and MediaPackage. Once you've completed that, the lab also provides steps on how to integrate MediaTailor with AWS CloudFront.

## Prerequisites
This lab assumes that you have the following:
1. An AWS Elemental MediaLive channel set up to pass through SCTE-35 and pushing content to MediaPackage. Input to the channel must contain SCTE-35 Ad markers. 
1. An AWS Elemental MediaPackage channel set up to receive streams from MediaLive. The channel must have an Endpoint setup that has Ad Markers enabled. The Endpoint URL is needed to integrate with both MediaTailor and Cloudfront. 
1. An Ad Decision Server (ADS), or you may use a static VAST response XML hosted on a server. For this exercise, you will use a static VAST response XML hosted in S3. 

### Previous Modules

This module relies on the configuration of AWS Elemental MediaLive and AWS Elemental MediaPackage. You must successfully complete these previous modules before attempting this one. See Prerequisites.

## Implementation Instructions

### 1. Create an AWS Elemental MediaTailor Configuration 

**Step-by-step instructions**

1. From the AWS Management Console, choose **Services** then select **AWS Elemental MediaTailor**. Make sure you're in **us-east-1** region.

1. Click on **Create configuration**.

1. Enter `MyTestCampaign` for the **Configuration  Name**.

1. For the **Video content source**, enter the MediaPackage Endpoint URL with SCTE-35 markers enabled (this would be the endpoint of the primary MediaPackage channel from previous workshop) but  **_without the manifest filename_** . Below is a sample endpoint URL from MediaPackage console.

1. Enter `http://d2qohgpffhaffh.cloudfront.net/MediaTailor/VASTDemo.xml` for the **Ad decision server**. 

	![alt](MediaTailorConfig.png)

1. Click **Create Configuration**. Click on the **Configurations** link to see the configuration you just created. Click on **MyTestCampaign** to see the **Playback endpoints** populated with playback URLs. Note down the **HLS playback prefix** as you'll need it in the next section.


### 2. Test MediaTailor Playback 

1. To verify that ads are making it into your video stream, you may use a standalone video player to view the HLS playback endpoint such as QuickTime, VLC or any workstation-based player that supports HLS. Alternatively, you may use one of the following web-based players to stream your video: 

	* https://www.hlsplayer.net/
	* http://videojs.github.io/videojs-contrib-hls/
	* https://developer.jwplayer.com/tools/stream-tester/

1. Your full playback URL will be the **HLS playback prefix** (eg. _https://f445cfa805184f3e8d86dc2ac1137efa.mediatailor.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/master/cf6421621b389b384c1fd22e51603ee95db76ae0/MyTestCampaign/_)
concatenated with the **manifest filename of your MediaPackage playback endpoint** (eg. _index.m3u8_) 

	Provide the full playback URL to the player of your choice (eg.   _https://f445cfa805184f3e8d86dc2ac1137efa.mediatailor.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/master/cf6421621b389b384c1fd22e51603ee95db76ae0/MyTestCampaign/index.m3u8_)

1. You should see the main content of your video play for the first 30 seconds (if using input provided in the MediaLive lab), followed by ads, and then back to video content.

### 3. Integrate with Amazon CloudFront

**Step-by-step instructions**

#### 3a. Add Origins to Your Distribution 

1. From the AWS Management Console, choose **Services** then select **CloudFront**.

1. Click on **Create Distribution**. 

1. Select the **Web** delivery method for your content and hit the **Get Started** button. 

1. Under **Origin Settings**, enter the domain name of your origin for **Origin Domain Name**. In our case, this is the domain name of MediaPackage (eg. _547f72e6652371c3.mediapackage.us-east-1.amazonaws.com_)

1. Take the default for all the other settings. But scroll down until you see the **Comment** textbox and enter `CloudFront for MediaTailor`.

1. Click the **Create Distribution** button. This will take you back to the main Distribution page of cloudfront. Your distribution will be in an **In Progress** state. The quickest way to tell which of the Distributions is yours is by the comment you entered. 

1. While your Distribution is still **In Progress**, go ahead and select the same distribution by clicking on its ID. This will take you to its settings. 

1. Click on the **Origins** tab and select the origin you just added and hit **Edit**. Update the **Origin Protocol Policy** to **HTTPS**.  Click on **Yes, Edit** to save your changes.

1. Go back to the **Origins** tab, and click on the **Create Origin** button. 

1. Enter MediaTailor's hostname for the **Origin Domain Name**. This will come from the **HLS playback prefix** of MediaTailor (e.g. _f445cfa805184f3e8d86dc2ac1137efa.mediatailor.us-east-1.amazonaws.com_)

1. Update the **Origin Protocol Policy** to **HTTPS**. Click **Create**. 

1. Go back to the **Origins** tab, and click on the **Create Origin** button. 

1. Enter MediaTailor's ad server hostname for the **Origin Domain Name**. If MediaTailor is being set up in us-east-1 then the Origin is:
`ads.mediatailor.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

1. Update the **Origin Protocol Policy** to **HTTPS**.  Click on **Create**.

#### 3b. Add Cache Behaviors to Your Distribution

1. Click on the **Behaviors** tab and click on the **Create Behavior** button.

1. Enter `/out/v1/*` for the **Path Pattern**. 

1. Under **Origin**, select the MediaPackage origin. 

1. Click the **Create** button to add another cache behavior. 

1. Click on **Create Behavior** button. 

1. Enter `/v1/*` for the **Path Pattern**. 

1. Under **Origin**, select the MediaTailor origin. 

1. For **Query String Forwarding and Caching**, select **Forward all, cache based on all**. 

1. Click the **Create** button to add another cache behavior. 

1. Select the **Default** behavior, and click on the **Edit** button.

1. Make sure the **Origin** is pointed to the Ad Server origin (e.g. _ads.mediatailor.us-east-1.amazonaws.com_)

1. For **Query String Forwarding and Caching**, select **Forward all, cache based on all**. 

1. Click on **Yes, Edit** button. 

1. Double-check the precedence of the caching behavior as this matters. Your primary precedence should be the MediaTailor origin (precedence 0), followed by the MediaPackage origin (precedence 1), and lastly by the ads origin (which is at Precedence 2 and is the Default). If this is not the precedence reflected, select one of the Behaviors and **Change Precedence** by clicking on either the **Move Up** or **Move Down** button, to make the adjustment.

## Update MediaTailor Configuration with CloudFront Details

1. From the AWS Management Console, choose **Services** then select **AWS Elemental MediaTailor**.

1. Click on the Configuration (`MyTestCampaign`) you created in section 1 and hit the **Edit** button.

1. For the **CDN content segment prefix**, construct your URL by putting together the protocol, the CloudFront **Domain Name**, and the path of the MediaPackage endpoint URL. For example: _https://**d32ftvdskdjq4u.cloudfront.net**/out/v1/96e862ec32d548fabad6436ad4fe0285_

1. For the **CDN ad segment prefix**, construct your URL by putting together the protocol, and the CloudFront  **Domain Name**. For example: _https://d32ftvdskdjq4u.cloudfront.net_

	![alt](MediaTailorCDNSettings.png)


## Test MediaTailor Playback with CloudFront

1. Once your CloudFront distribution is in the **Deployed** status, and **Enabled** state, try playing back your stream using the same player you selected in section 2 of this lab. Take your playback URL from Section 2, Step 2 and replace the MediaTailor hostname with the CloudFront **Domain Name** that was assigned to your distribution. 

	For example, if your MediaTailor playback URL is: _https://**f445cfa805184f3e8d86dc2ac1137efa.mediatailor.us-east-1.amazonaws.com**/v1/master/cf6421621b389b384c1fd22e51603ee95db76ae0/MyTestCampaign/index.m3u8_


	then your CloudFront playback URL is:
	_https://**d32ftvdskdjq4u.cloudfront.net**/v1/master/cf6421621b389b384c1fd22e51603ee95db76ae0/MyTestCampaign/index.m3u8_)
